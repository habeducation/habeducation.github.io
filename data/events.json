Abstract: High altitude balloons are valuable tools for planetary science observation. They are an inexpensive means to simulate the conditions of space, and are commonly used in K-12 and university-level science and engineering classrooms. Here, we broadly present opportunities for their application in education and scientific discovery and show results from our collaboration with the YMCA to teach 6th-8th grade students from Loyola Academy of Saint Louis."
