# How to build your own robust tracker.
If you can understand how to download and order your parts from Javi Martin's Trackuino build on [GitHub](https://github.com/trackuino/shield), go for it! Here, we have tried to simplify the build process.

### Order your parts
+ First, see our spreadsheet listing parts, associated costs, and links [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RLA8SSVwn3HaUln8249NUDaPOu1tWUI6GSjrsH7iYlQ/edit)
+ Order your printed circuit board [here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/MMW9Ewt5). Order most of your parts that you will solder mount onto your printed circuit board [here](http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=323ef42bae). In addition to your board and surface mount parts, you will need a GPS antennae, GPS chip, VHF transmitter, a VHF antenna, a genuine arduino with programming cable, a pack of eight lithium batteries and holder with barrel jack to plug into your trackuino. Please see the spreadsheet for links to these items.

### Watch a video to learn how to assemble your parts.
