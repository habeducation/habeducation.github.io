A high altitude balloon (HAB) is an unmanned balloon typically filled with helium or hydrogen that reaches heights of 18 to 37 km (60k-120k feet, or 11 to 23 mi). HABs can tell us a lot about the atmosphere. One type of HAB is the weather balloon, and it is used to collect information from the lowest of five atmospheric layers, the troposphere. This first layer contains half of the earth’s atmosphere and is where most of the earth’s weather occurs.  This page documents our first attempt at building HAB_0 equipped with a 1000g latex balloon that should reach ~100k feet. The crew includes Donald Bindner, [Dustin Mayfield-Jones](http://mayfieldjones.com/), Derek Sigler, and Huan Truong. Derek has launched three previous launches, AR1-AR3. Much of the assembly has taken place at the Saint Louis Arch Reactor hacker space. The main goal of HAB_0 is to successfully build, launch, and recover our HAB while gaining skills for future maker projects. Beautiful video is a plus. A desired outcome of this work is to collaborate with schools to encourage student learning in the areas of atmospheric science, software development, and/or electrical engineering.
