The main goals of HAB_0 were accomplished.

•  Payload successfully launched and recovered

•  HD video of entire flight

•  >10 informative variables recorded during entire flight

Of note, the maximum altitude was slightly higher than previous flights, probably due to the significantly lighter payload (~1350g). The ascent rate of 270m/s remained relatively constant during the duration of the ascent. Several layers of variable wind speeds were identified. In general, three wind layers were identified before the first jet stream wind was detected, followed by a region of slow moving air, followed by another jet stream wind. We expect a change in wind direction between the troposphere and the stratosphere, but we have yet to fully analyze our data.

Unexpectedly, it is clear that the temperature continues to drop until the balloon reaches the altitude of maximal ozone, as inferred from our three temperature measurements and oxidizing gas measurements.  Both our internal Trackuino- and Sensordrone-based temperature measurements are consistent throughout the flight. Temperature continued to rise until the point of balloon burst. As temperature decreased during descent, the Trackuino system experienced a substantial drop in voltage to 7.7 V by the end of the flight. The relationship between pressure and altitude will soon be determined. The Sensordrone instrument’s ambient temperature and infrared temperature measurements yielded relatively equivalent measurements of internal payload temperature. We interpret from our humidity data that the two clear peaks at ~6,000m (~20,000 ft) altitude indicate clouds.

A desired outcome of this work is to collaborate with schools to encourage student learning in the areas of atmospheric science, software development and data analysis methods, and/or electrical engineering. Student learning outcomes have been identified. If you are interested in this content and/or teaming up to use HABs to teach STEM in 2015/2016, please contact Dustin.
