# New flight data from Loyola Launch visualized with D3


Our new flight launched from Damiensville, IL  was a blast!

Try and compare the data from our first launch, HAB_0, with the latest launch, Loyola, below. These flights collected data from the months of March and April about one year apart, 3-14-15 and 4-16-16. Both flights were launched from the same location.
