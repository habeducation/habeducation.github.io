# D3 Graphs for HAB.JS


When we launched HAB_0, we received a lot of data from our payload about things
like the altitude, pressure, humidity, tempurature, and flightpath of the
balloon. To help make sense of the data, we made this app in D3.js to help us
visualize the results, and we thought it would be great to share it! You can
choose different variables to plot using the dropdown box below, and the new
graph will automatically appear with the results


So go ahead and give it a whirl, select the variables you want to plot against
each other!

{% include hab.js.html %}
